        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <img src="//assets/images/(image file name)"></img>

        <p>I was born in Wurtzberg, Germany on October 5th 1991. Moved to Korea and lived there until I was in 5th
            grade. I then moved to Olympia, Washington and have lived there ever since.
            I am a younger brother to a loving older sister named Sarah. I played the trumpet and tenor saxophone
            throughout middle school and high school. My mother was quite disappointed when I decided
            not to continue playing in my adult years. I also enjoyed playing tennis throughout high school. Decided to
            go to college at Central Washington and graduated with a BS in Biology and minor in Chemistry.
            I did not end up working in that field which brings me to the UW BootCamp class which I could not be more
            excited for.

            Some of the things I enjoy in my spare time are staying active and riding my bike when the weather is nice.
            On lazy Sunday's I may sit down to play some online video games although I don't imagine having very many of
            those
            days while taking this BootCamp course. Besides coding I am currently learning how to cook because who
            enjoys eating the same meals over and over again. One day I hope to work with a development team on mobile
            app devlopemnt
            or even video game devlopment if I can get to that level. Only time and a ton of effort will tell.
